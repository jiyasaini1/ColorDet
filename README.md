# Python Color Detector

Welcome to the Python Color Detector project repository! In this repository, I've created a color detection script using Python and OpenCV. The script can identify colors in an image and display the color's name and RGB values. Let's explore the details of the project.

## About the Color Detector

The Python Color Detector is a simple yet powerful tool that lets you extract color information from images. By clicking on different areas of the image, you'll be able to see the corresponding color's name and its RGB values. This project can be useful for various applications, such as image processing, graphic design, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive Color Detection:** Click on an area of the image to detect the color's name and RGB values.
- **Color Information Display:** Display the color name and RGB values on the image.
- **Color CSV Database:** Utilize a CSV file containing color names and corresponding RGB values.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:** Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.

2. **CSV File:** Ensure the `colors.csv` file is present in the same directory as your script. This file contains color names and their RGB values.

3. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script to open the color detection window.

4. **Color Detection:** Click on different areas of the image to detect and display color information.

5. **Exit:** Press the `Esc` key to close the color detection window.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with the Python Color Detector:

- Click on a blue sky in the image to get the color name "Sky Blue" with RGB values (135, 206, 235).
- Explore various shades in the image and observe the accurate color detection.

## Contribution

I welcome contributions to enhance this project.
